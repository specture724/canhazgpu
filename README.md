# canhazgpu

***A GPU reservation tool for single host shared development systems***

![canhazgpu mascot](docs/images/mascot-small.png)

In shared development environments with multiple GPUs, researchers and developers often face conflicts when trying to use GPUs simultaneously, leading to out-of-memory errors, failed training runs, and wasted time debugging resource conflicts. This utility provides a simple reservation system that coordinates GPU access across multiple users and processes on a single machine.

### Who this is for

You peacefully share a host but want a helper to avoid accidental conflicts.

- You have a single host with NVIDIA GPUs, AMD GPUs, or Huawei Ascend NPUs shared by multiple users
- You all log in and run commands manually for development and/or testing
- You can still talk to each other about playing nice and sharing your GPUs

### Who this is NOT for

If your needs are more than this, you probably want something more powerful like Kubernetes.

- You want to manage resources across a cluster
- You want to set resource usage limits or other policies
- You want to support workload priorities and preemption

## Quick Start

```bash
# Start Redis server listening on localhost:6379
# This is the default configuration in most cases.

# Initialize GPU pool
canhazgpu admin --gpus 8

# Check current status
canhazgpu status

# Run vLLM with an automatic 2 GPU reservation.
# - The provider visibility variable is set before running the command
#   (CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES for NVIDIA/AMD; ASCEND_RT_VISIBLE_DEVICES for Ascend).
# - If GPUs are unavailable, waits in queue until they become available.
canhazgpu run --gpus 2 -- vllm serve my/model --tensor-parallel-size 2

# Reserve specific GPUs by ID (waits if unavailable)
canhazgpu run --gpu-ids 1,3 -- python train.py

# Fail immediately if GPUs unavailable (no queueing)
canhazgpu run --nonblock --gpus 2 -- python train.py

# Wait up to 30 minutes for GPUs, then fail
canhazgpu run --wait 30m --gpus 4 -- python train.py

# Run interactive programs (full TTY support)
canhazgpu run --gpus 1 -- python  # Interactive Python REPL
canhazgpu run --gpus 1 -- codex   # Interactive coding assistant

# Check the reservation queue
canhazgpu queue

# Reserve a single GPU manually for development
canhazgpu reserve --gpus 1 --duration 4h

# Reserve specific GPU IDs manually
canhazgpu reserve --gpu-ids 0,2 --duration 2h

# Reserve NVIDIA/AMD GPUs and set CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES in one step (for scripting)
export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=$(canhazgpu reserve --gpus 2 --short)

# For Ascend, use the CANN visibility variable instead.
export ASCEND_RT_VISIBLE_DEVICES=$(canhazgpu reserve --gpus 2 --short)

# Release manual reservations when done
canhazgpu release

# Generate reservation reports
canhazgpu report --days 7

# Start web dashboard
canhazgpu web --port 8080
```

## Key Features

- **Interactive program support**: Full TTY support for interactive programs like Python REPL, codex, vim
- **Fair queueing**: FCFS queue ensures fair access when GPUs are busy - requests wait automatically
- **Race condition protection**: Uses Redis-based distributed locking
- **Automatic cleanup**: GPUs auto-released when processes end, reservations expire, or a run job stops using its GPUs (30-minute idle timeout by default)
- **MRU-per-user allocation**: Smart GPU affinity using most recently used per-user strategy with LRU fallback
- **Specific GPU reservation**: Reserve exact GPU IDs when needed (e.g., --gpu-ids 1,3)
- **Unreserved usage detection**: Identifies GPUs in use without proper reservations
- **Real-time validation**: Uses nvidia-smi, amd-smi, or npu-smi to verify actual device usage
- **Multi-provider support**: Supports NVIDIA, AMD, and Huawei Ascend devices with automatic detection
- **Flexible reservations**: Support for both command execution and manual reservations
- **Reservation reporting**: Track and analyze GPU reservation patterns over time by user
- **Web dashboard**: Real-time monitoring interface with status and reservation reports

## Web Dashboard

![canhazgpu Dashboard Screenshot](docs/images/web-screenshot.png)

The web dashboard provides:
- Real-time GPU status monitoring with automatic refresh
- Queue status with wait times and allocation progress
- Interactive reservation reports with customizable time periods
- Visual status indicators and usage visualization
- Quick access to documentation and source code

Start the dashboard with `canhazgpu web` and access it at http://localhost:8080

## Requirements

- **Go 1.25+** (for building from source)
- **Redis server** running on localhost:6379
- **GPUs** with appropriate management tools:
  - **NVIDIA GPUs**: nvidia-smi available
  - **AMD GPUs**: amd-smi available (ROCm 5.7+)
  - **Huawei Ascend NPUs** (including 910B1): npu-smi available and the CANN runtime configured for the user
- **System access** to `/proc` filesystem or `ps` command

## Installation

```bash
# Option 1: Homebrew (recommended for macOS/Linux)
brew tap russellb/canhazgpu
brew install canhazgpu
# Installs both 'canhazgpu' and 'chg' (short alias), plus bash completion

# Option 2: Install directly from GitHub
go install github.com/russellb/canhazgpu@latest

# Option 3: Build from source
git clone https://github.com/russellb/canhazgpu.git
cd canhazgpu
make install
```

Then initialize the GPU pool:

```bash
canhazgpu admin --gpus $(nvidia-smi -L | wc -l)  # For NVIDIA
# OR
canhazgpu admin --gpus $(amd-smi list --json | jq 'length')  # For AMD
# OR (example: eight Ascend NPUs)
canhazgpu admin --gpus 8 --provider ascend  # For Huawei Ascend
```

## How It Works

1. **Validation**: Uses nvidia-smi, amd-smi, or npu-smi to detect actual device usage and identify conflicts
2. **Coordination**: Uses Redis for distributed state management and race condition prevention
3. **Queueing**: FCFS queue; the first entry whose full request can be satisfied is allocated, so no GPUs are held by a job that cannot start yet
4. **Allocation**: MRU-per-user (Most Recently Used per user) strategy provides GPU affinity with LRU fallback for fair distribution
5. **Monitoring**: Heartbeat system tracks active reservations and handles cleanup
6. **Enforcement**: Automatically excludes unreserved GPU usage from allocation
